Purpose: to define the way we want to work together as a team on the project. Refer to Scrum and Agile books to help you plan your strategy. Expect it to evolve as you gain more experience.

 

## TEAM:

Team Name: (something agile like LEMUR!)

Team Members: (Names)

 

 

Which degrees are you each studying towards?

 

 

## ASPIRATIONS:

What do each of you want to get out of the project and CT5038 apart from a pass? (Each member writes a sentence)

 

 

 

Do you have something in common about your aspirations? Can you make this a driving force for your work on this project?

 

 

 

## COMMITMENTS: (What commitments can you make about working on the project?)

How much time is each of you prepared to commit to this project each week?

 

 

Which day and at what time will this team meet to work together?

(Recommendation is that you are together for at least 3 hours each week)

 

 

 

## ORGANISATION: 

Where will you keep your Product & Sprint backlogs and any other documentation you are working on so that it is available to all team members?

 

 

How will you allocate Sprint backlog tasks to team members?

(What are the team’s strengths, and can you allocate tasks to take advantage of them?)

 

 

 

How will you update the task list in your Sprint backlog to show progress?

(Will you review progress each week at your team meeting or update daily?)

 

 

How and when will you prepare for the Sprint review meeting?

(At a Sprint review you demonstrate the functionality in your application to the client using your test data. There will be 2 Sprint review meetings during the project.)

 

 

 

## PRODUCT VISION:

Please attach additional sheets of paper that show your Product Vision Box and Product Vision Statement.

 

 

## SIGNATURES: (All team members sign this Team Vision document)
